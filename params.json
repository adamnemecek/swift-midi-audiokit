  "body": "# Swift + AudioKit :heart: MIDI\r\n\r\nDemos, examples, [code kata's](http://codekata.com/) and etudes.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe USC Radio Labs team is excited to see the arrival of two new technologies for music, [Swift](https://swift.org/) lang and [AudioKit](http://audiokit.io/). These two technologies make it easier to create new instruments for musicians and push the needle forward on music. \r\n\r\n\r\nTo share our excitement and commitment to helping create new products and platforms for music, we're open sourcing a few demos for software engineers interested in working with [MIDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI). \r\n\r\n\r\n### Why MIDI?\r\n\r\nWe are excited to see MIDI go through a [renaissance online](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/05/google-chrome-gains-midi-support-enables-web-based-synths-and-daws/) (thank you [Chrome team](https://blog.chromium.org/2015/04/chrome-43-beta-web-midi-and-upgrading.html)!). As part of our mission to help promote classical music online, we felt it was best to provide developers with examples of how to work with MIDI performances using AudioKit and Swift. \r\n\r\n\r\n### MIDI? Really? Isn't there something better?\r\n\r\nAlthough the MIDI spec could use more regular updates, it's still the best technology for musicians who want to mix and match different digital instruments. It's also the best standard for digital instrument makers to create new products that can interface with instruments dating back to the 1980's. If you think instruments like [this](http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/jup6.php) look cool, then it's worth it to continue embracing MIDI. \r\n\r\n\r\nUSC Radio Interactive is excited to help make music creation more accessible.  We feel the best way to do that is by providing software engineers with examples of how MIDI can work with iOS. \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Resources\r\n\r\n\r\n### MIDI performances from the community\r\n\r\n- [Classical Archives](http://www.classicalarchives.com/midi.html)\r\n- [Kunst der Fuge](http://www.kunstderfuge.com/)\r\n- [AM Classical MIDI](http://www.amclassical.com/midi/)\r\n- [MIDI World](http://www.midiworld.com/classic.htm/)\r\n- [Classical Piano](http://www.piano-midi.de/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### MIDI tech from the community\r\n\r\n- [Web Audio Demos](http://webaudiodemos.appspot.com/)\r\n- [MIDI Converter](http://tonejs.github.io/MidiConvert/)\r\n- [MIDI Synth](https://github.com/cwilso/midi-synth)\r\n- [Web MIDI API Polyfill](https://github.com/cwilso/WebMIDIAPIShim)\r\n- [MIDI JSON Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/midi-json-parser)\r\n- [Pg MIDI](https://github.com/petegoodliffe/PGMidi)\r\n\r\n### Other useful links and resources\r\n\r\n- [Timing in MIDI](http://sites.uci.edu/camp2014/2014/05/19/timing-in-midi-files/)\r\n- [MIDI](http://www.deluge.co/?q=core-midi-core-audio-useful-links)\r\n- [Handling MIDI events](http://www.slideshare.net/invalidname/core-midi-and-friends)\r\n- [MIDI for games](http://www.indiegamemusic.com/help.php?id=3)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Noteworthy SoundFonts\r\n\r\n- [Ultimate MIDI tutorial](http://www.deluge.co/?q=ultimate-midi-tutorial-iphone-ipad)\r\n- [Sound Fonts](http://www.root.immersiondesign.co.uk/Downloads/sound_font.tar.gz)\r\n- [Soundfont Library](http://www.hammersound.com/cgi-bin/soundlink.pl)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# About USC Radio Labs\r\n\r\nUSC Radio Labs is a department of [USC Radio Group](http://uscradiogroup.org) dedicated to producing new music products, services, and experiences for listeners, musicians, tastemakers and arts partners worldwide.
